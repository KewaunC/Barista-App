## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, REACT 

I was challenge to creat an app where the customer could input their coffee order and then the barista would complete the order and the terminal would shout out the customers name

## Optimizations

I utiilized both back-end and front-end to make my first ever Full-Stack Web Application and wow does it feel surreal. I wanted to make the interface as user friendly and easy to navigate.

## Lessons Learned:

THIS was alot on my plate but I believe I did a really good job I defiatenly had alot of fun with this challenge and I wish I could go back and tweak some things but overall I'm completely happy with what I put out
